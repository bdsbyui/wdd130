        <p>This site is a gathering spot for the Smith Family. As the family
            grows and is dispersed around the country and the globe, we can 
            gather here to continue sharing our current lives as we prepare to 
            be together for the eternal ones.</p>
        <p>Curently this site has two pages beyond this home page: Calendar 
            and Games.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Calendar page is currently limited to our travel itineraries 
              this summer. This should help everyone see who will be where and 
              when, and enable family in Arizona and New York (and Jacob in 
              Tennesse) to know when to expect us--and when to look forward to 
              our departure! In this future, it will be a tool for remembering 
              birthdays and flagging important events.</li>
          <li>The Games page is currently limited to the Wordle game that I 
              built with JavaScript. Like games? Want to learn how to code one? 
              Let's talk!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Future pages will include dedicated pages for your individual use 
            (if you want one), family history, recipies, photo albums, and 
            contact information, to include social media details. Ultimately, 
            this site is intended to provide custom content that complements 
            what you are already using. This is <span>your</span> site, if 
            you'll have it. Let me know what you would like to see and what you 
            would like to share.</p>
