    <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>I grew up in the Arizona and Oregon and served a mission in Japan. My wife was born in Colombia, raised in Venezuela, and served a mission in eastern Washington. We met one fateful weekend in New York. We have five children. My eldest son served in Honduras until the pandemic imposed a reassignment to St. Louis. He now attends Southern Virginia University. My eldest daughter is attending Eastern Arizona College. The remaining three attend the Internatial School Manila.</p>
    <h3>Career and Education</h3>
        <p>We live in the Philippines where I work as a diplomat. I have seen the world and found the past two-plus decades to be a great experience for my family. I graduated from BYU in the 1990s with a degree in International Studies-Global Economy. After my wife started with Pathway and began taking BYU-I courses, I realized I was missing out on the fun. Now as a fellow student, I get to learn all the interesting subjects that I did not get to study--or that did not exist (hint: Web Fundamentals)--the first time around.</p>
    <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I am an inactive private pilot who hopes to get back in the air someday when there is more time and money.</p>
